# Overview
**Work In Progress**


## Structure
**Work In Progress**


## Format

**Work In Progress**

The following template should be used when adding a projectile to the dataset. This template may evolve over time and backward-compatibility should be maintained to the best of our abilities. Language-specific packages based off of this dataset should use semantic versioning to ensure that format changes don't break userspace.


### Units of measure

Projectiles are often defined in both the Metric and Imperial units of measure. In order to provide maximum flexibility, **both units must be provided** in the specification file.
